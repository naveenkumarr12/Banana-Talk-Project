        <strong>Minionese</strong>, as it's known, is a constructed language
        created by Despicable Me co-directors <strong>Pierre Coffin</strong> and
        <strong>Chris Renaud</strong>. Minionese, sometimes called
        <em>Banana Language</em> because of the Minions' love of the
        yellow-skinned fruit, is a combination of several real languages,
        including French, Italian, Spanish, Indian(Hindi mostly), Japanese, and,
        of course, English, among others.<br />
